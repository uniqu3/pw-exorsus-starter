TEXTAREAS FIELDTYPE CHANGELOG
=============================
v7 - April 3, 2017
-------------------
* Combined bugfixes, tweaks and upgrades for 2016-Q1 2017

v6 - August 7, 2015
-------------------
* Add support for ajax editing mode (PW 2.6.12+). 
* Add support for individual "notes" fields for each property. 
* Add support for searching individual properties from selectors. 
* Add support for display of individual properties from Lister/ListerPro. 
* Add support for filtering of individual properties from Lister/ListerPro. 
* Add support for markupValue (as used in Lister/ListerPro output).

v5 - March 2, 2015
-----------------------

* This Fieldtype is now capable of supporting nearly any kind of data type
  rather than just strings. Examples include Pages, single and multi-choice
  user definable options (outside of pages), checkbox toggles, dates, 
  integers, floats and more. It will also work with many 3rd party Inputfields.
  At this point, we should probably rename this Fieldtype to something 
  different, as the name is no longer reflective of what it does, so we'll 
  likely change the name of it by version 6! 

v4 - October 21, 2014
--------------------------

* Added new options for multi-language support. See the new multi-language
  support section in the README.txt file, near the bottom. 

* Added support for individually specified field widths. Now you can specify
  what width you want each property in your Textareas field to be. When used
  this overrides any default you may have specified on the Input tab. For 
  instructions, see the description on the "Textarea Definitions" field 
  present on the "Details" tab when editing any Textareas field.
