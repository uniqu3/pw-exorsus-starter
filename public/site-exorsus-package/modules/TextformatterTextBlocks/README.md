# ProcessWire ProFields: Text Blocks Textformatter

This is a commercially licensed and supported module, do not distribute. 

## Introduction

For a full introduction to this module, use cases and examples, please see:
https://processwire.com/blog/posts/text-blocks/


## How to install and use

### Install

1. Copy all the files in this directory to:
   /site/modules/TextformatterTextBlocks/ 

2. In your admin, go to Modules > Refresh. 

3. Click the "Install" button next to Text Blocks. 

4. Determine which Textarea fields you want Text Blocks to be supported. 
   Locate those fields in Setup > Fields and edit them. The most likely 
   scenario is that you would apply it to your "body" field. When
   editing your field, go to the "Details" tab and select "Text Blocks"
   from the "Text formatters" select box. Save. 
   

### Test it out to make sure it is working

Edit any page that has a field using the Text Blocks text formatter. 
Define a block like this:

   start-hello
   
   Hello World!
   
   stop-hello
   
Now go and edit another page that also has this field, and enter the 
following somewhere in the text:

   show-hello
   
When viewing the page, you should see the "Hello World!" text.
